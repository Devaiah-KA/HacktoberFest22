<h2> 
<p align=center>The Commissioner Panchayati Raj and Rural 
Development has initiated Digital Panchayat ,a Flagship G2C 
project, for Computerization and online issuance of citizen centric 
certificates. After a detailed system study by NIC, the department 
prioritized the applications to be automated for gram Panchayats. 
The application areas are Birth & Death Registrations, House Tax 
Demand Collections, Trade Licenses, Property valuation, 
mutations, water tap connection, NOC, Building permission, 
Layout permissions and MNREGA. These applications provide an
end to end solution for all the gram panchayats in the state. The 
software facilitates generation of certificates, payment gateway 
for citizens, eSign facility for panchayat functionaries, SMS and
email alerts. The Computerisation of all the 3-tiers of PRIs i.e Zilla 
Praja Parishad , Mandal Praja Parishad(Block) and Gram 
Panchayats is also in place.</p>
